**YES — 100% you should do user research**, but **lightweight**, fast, and focused.
Not the boring corporate style — the **startup-style user research** that actually helps you build a product people want.

And you already identified a GREAT niche:
✅ People who write Markdown
✅ Competitive programmers
✅ Developers
✅ Technical writers
✅ People tired of Google Docs
✅ People who love keyboard-driven, fast tools

This is an EXCELLENT target audience because:

* They are active on GitHub
* They contribute to open source
* They share tools publicly
* They love productivity enhancers
* They use Markdown already
* They will star your repo
* They will contribute plugins
* They are early adopters

This is EXACTLY the audience that grew Excalidraw, Obsidian, dub.sh, Raycast, etc.

# ✅ How to do user research **correctly** (for your situation)

You only need **3 things**:

---

# ✅ **Step 1: Identify 10–15 target users**

Types of people to talk to:

* Competitive programmers
* Devs who write README/docs
* Students writing notes in MD
* People using Obsidian, HackMD, Typora
* People who write blog posts in Markdown
* GitHub users

You already know many CPers — **your own network is your goldmine**.

---

# ✅ **Step 2: Ask EXACTLY these 8 questions**

Don’t ask general questions like “What feature do you want?”
Ask about their daily workflows, pains, frustrations.

Use these:

### ✅ 1. “Where do you currently write Markdown?”

* VSCode? Obsidian? HackMD? GitHub?
  This tells you what tools you’re competing against.

### ✅ 2. “What annoys you the most about your current tool?”

This gives you **instant roadmap items**.

### ✅ 3. “Do you collaborate in real-time, or mostly solo?”

If many say “solo", maybe collaboration is not your #1 priority.
If many say “Yes, we write CP editorials in team”, real-time editing is huge.

### ✅ 4. “Do you use LaTeX frequently?”

CPers definitely do.

### ✅ 5. “Do you prefer keyboard-driven tools?”

Your tool can position itself as:
**“A keyboard-first Markdown editor.”**

### ✅ 6. “Do you need export formats? (PDF, MD, HTML)”

This influences priority.

### ✅ 7. “Would you use a clean, fast, instant collaborative MD editor?”

You’ll get YES from 80% because Google Docs is too heavy.

### ✅ 8. “Would you pay for extra features or hosting?”

(To understand future monetization)

---

# ✅ **Step 3: Show them a mockup (even a screenshot)**

People give MUCH better feedback if you show them:

* A screenshot of the editor
* A simple Figma wireframe
* A 10-second GIF

Ask:

### ✅ “Is this something you can imagine yourself using?”

### ✅ “What is missing that would make it perfect for you?”

### ✅ “Would this replace your current MD workflow?”

The answers will tell you the EXACT direction of the product.

---

# ✅ Suggested Key Hypotheses to Test

You should validate these 5 things:

### ✅ Hypothesis 1 — People want a **Google Docs alternative for developers**

Fast, clean, Markdown-first.

### ✅ Hypothesis 2 — People want **collaboration** but not heavy docs like Notion

Especially for technical notes, CP editorials, documentation.

### ✅ Hypothesis 3 — Competitive programmers want **Markdown + LaTeX + code blocks**

Google Docs is trash for this.

### ✅ Hypothesis 4 — People prefer **keyboard-first workflows**

VSCode-level speed but in the browser.

### ✅ Hypothesis 5 — People hate switching between markdown editors and preview

Your preview panel is a unique selling point.

---

# ✅ Why user research matters for YOUR GOAL

You want:

✅ Open source
✅ To build a big community
✅ To become popular like Excalidraw
✅ To make money eventually

Your success depends on one thing:

**People using the product because it solves a REAL pain.**

Not because it’s “good tech.”

---

# ✅ Lightweight user research plan (you can do today)

### ✅ Tweet/WhatsApp status:

> “I’m building a fast, beautiful Markdown + LaTeX collaborative editor.
> What pain do you face with current Markdown tools?
> Would love to hear.”

### ✅ Google Form with 8 questions

Super short form → higher response rate.

### ✅ Ask 5 friends who are CPers or developers

(Your community is already strong.)

### ✅ Post in your college tech club

Perfect early adopters.

### ✅ Post on Reddit

Subreddits:

* r/CompetitiveProgramming
* r/webdev
* r/ObsidianMD
* r/Notion
* r/Productivity
* r/webapps

---

# ✅ You don’t need 100 users

**10–15 interview-quality responses** = enough to shape your MVP.

The goal is not perfection.
The goal is to *align your MVP with real problems*, not guessed problems.

---

# ✅ Summary

✅ Yes, do user research
✅ Keep it lightweight and actionable
✅ Focus on 10–15 target users
✅ Use the 8 powerful questions above
✅ Show mockups early
✅ Validate your high-level direction

---

If you want, I can create a:

✅ Google Form template
✅ User research questions
✅ Survey intro text
✅ Even a Figma wireframe for Fast Docs MVP

Just tell me what you want.
